Extraction of invoice information to be organized in “xls” format with the help of a detection model (YOLO11n) and an OCR model (https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/trocr).

The YOLO model was trained and tested with the SROEI2019 dataset https://pan.baidu.com/s/1a57eKCSq8SV8Njz8-jO4Ww#list/path=%2FSROIE2019&parentPath=%2F.

To use this model, just run the “ocr_extraction.py” file (an image or file containing the SROIE2019 dataset must be selected) and either of the two best weights in the folder runs

This project is for the purpose of self-learning in the detection and extraction of invoice information.
